# UFO-Analayis


## Overview of Project
We were tasked with making a webpage and dynamic table for multiple search criteria of UFO sightings.  You can now search by date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO.  

## Results
Below is a screen shot of the unsorted data table and filters.

Now if we were to want to sort it by only UFOs in the state of texas we would simply write in the texas state code in the enter state blank and hit enter.  That will filter the table to return these results.

You can change what your filtering on and write it over any blank and refilter to continue to look at different slices of the data.

## Summary
One drawback the limitation on data.  Collecting and scrubbing more data would make the website better.  Also, the website is not very intuitive.  Maybe by correcting for small spelling errors it would be easier to use.
