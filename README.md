# UFO-Analayis


## Overview of Project
We were tasked with making a webpage and dynamic table for multiple search criteria of UFO sightings.  You can now search by date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO.  

## Results
Below is a screen shot of the unsorted data table and filters.

Now if we were to want to sort it by only UFOs in the state of texas we would simply write in the texas state code in the enter state blank and hit enter.  That will filter the table to return these results.

You can change what your filtering on and write it over any blank and refilter to continue to look at different slices of the data.

## Summary
One drawback is that the filters do not stack.  Such as, when i filter by the state of California, the table returns many results.  I cannot then refine the search to be california and only a circle shape.  This would need to be addressed before going public with this site.  I would also like to find more data.  It appears the data only covers about 2 weeks.  Maybe by scraping other websites that house databases of this information we could expand our data list.
